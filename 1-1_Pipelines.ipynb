    "As an ML practitioner, you are probably familiar with building ML models using Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar. An **[ML Pipeline](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide)** is simply an extension, including other steps you would typically do before or after building a model, like data acquisition, preprocessing, model deployment, or monitoring. The ML pipeline essentially defines a step-by-step procedure of your work as an ML practitioner. Defining ML pipelines explicitly in code is great because:\n",
    "- We can easily rerun all of our work, not just the model, eliminating bugs and making our models easier to reproduce.\n",
    "- Data and models can be versioned and tracked, so we can see at a glance which dataset a model was trained on and how it compares to other models.\n",
    "- If the entire pipeline is coded up, we can automate many operational tasks, like retraining and redeploying models when the underlying problem or data changes or rolling out new and improved models with CI/CD workflows.\n",
