    "***Key Concepts:*** *Inference Pipelines*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we learned how to add model deployment as a step in our ML pipeline, which allows us to automatically deploy models into production after training them. We also saw how to interact with the served model manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, querying the model is just one of many steps you would have to perform at inference time. Whenever you receive a request, you might need to preprocess the data you received, and you might also have some postprocessing code that you want to run after your model, like converting outputs to a different format, sending alerts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why it makes sense to use ML pipelines not only for model training but also for inference. To prevent [training-serving skew](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml#training-serving_skew), we might want to reuse some of the steps from our training pipeline when defining the inference pipeline. This is particularly important for steps like data preprocessing, which we expect to behave similarly in both environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the two pipelines are decoupled and can run independently from each other. In practice, the overall workflow looks like this: \n",
    "1. We run the training pipeline to train and deploy a model,\n",
    "2. Whenever an inference request comes in, the inference pipeline sends data to the currently deployed model and receives the corresponding model prediction,\n",
    "3. Whenever we rerun the training pipeline, a new model will be trained and deployed that will overwrite the previously deployed model (or slowly phase it out).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Training and Inference Pipelines GIF](_assets/2-3/training_inference_pipelines.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a rudimentary inference pipeline to interact with our served model. \n",
    "The pipeline will consist of the following three steps:\n",
    "1. Load a data sample\n",
    "2. Load the model (prediction service)\n",
    "3. Inference the model on the data sample\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's import zenml and rebuild and rerun the deployment pipeline from the last lesson:"
